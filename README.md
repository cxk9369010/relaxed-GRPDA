Golden ratio primal-dual algorithm: relaxed conditions and connection to Chambolle-Pock’s primal-dual algorithm


We establish ergodic sublinear convergence rate results based on function value residual and constraint violation of an equivalently reformulated constrained optimization problem, rather than the so-called primal-dual gap function, which was used previously and could vanish at nonstationary points. For convex optimization problem with linear equality constraints and regularized least squares problem, we further show that GRPDA and Chambolle-Pock’s primal-dual algorithm are equivalent provided that some parameters are chosen properly. Finally, we present preliminary numerical results on LASSO problem to demonstrate the performance of GRPDA with ψ chosen in the expanded region (1, 1 + √3).
